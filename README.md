# OS-Project-Reader-Writer-Problem
<h2>Requiment</h2>
<pre>Here one has a system of r readers and w writers that all access a common database (or some
other resource). A reader may share the resource with an unlimited number of other readers,
but a writer must be in exclusive control of the resource. We call this the RW problem. Two
additional constraints characterize variants of the problem. Find a solution to each of the
following RW1 and RW2 problem, which does not cause starvation of readers and writers.
(a) Problem RW1. As soon as a writer is ready to write, no new reader should get permission
to run. Starvation of readers is a possibility here.
(b) Problem RW2. No writer is permitted to start running if there are any waiting readers.
Here it is possible to starve the writers.
